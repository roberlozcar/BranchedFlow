# Branched Flow Simulator

## Introduction

The branched flows are simulated in this program as particles moving in a random potential. This potential is much lower than the kinetic energy of the particle.

In this way, it simulates a scattering process.

## Options

- In the console you can input the number of paths you want yo simulate.
- With "n" you can calculate the next step of the paths.
- A screenshot can be done pressing "s".

## Instalation

Build with CMake and move the bin dll to the same folder of the compiled executable. 

You may have to move the shaders folder to the parent folder of the executable.

## Requeriments

This project needs glm, glew, glut and freeimage. The headers, libs and dlls for win32 are included in this repository.
